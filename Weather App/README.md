# Weather App

This is a simple weather app that allows users to search for weather information based on city names.

## Features

- **City Search:** Users can enter a city name in the search bar to find weather information for that city.
- **Dynamic Suggestions:** As the user types, the app provides dynamic suggestions for city names based on the input.
- **Current Weather Data:** The app displays current weather data for the selected city, including temperature, weather description, and other relevant details.

## Notes

I am using two APIs here: OpenWeatherMap and GeoBD Cities. Since it costs to use these APIs, I've created placeholder APIs which are used to retrieve the city and weather data.
