# Real-Time Chat Application

This is a real-time chat application built using Node.js and Socket.io. It allows users to communicate with each other in real-time through text messages.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication:** Users can send and receive messages instantly without needing to refresh the page.
- **Simple Interface:** The chat interface is easy to use and intuitive.
- **Multiple Users:** Multiple users can join the chat room simultaneously and participate in conversations.

## Usage

- Upon opening the application in your web browser, you will be presented with the chat interface.
- Enter your desired username and start sending messages in the chat input box.
- Other users who join the chat room will be able to see your messages in real-time, and you will see their messages as well.

## Notes

This project is really simple.

I may come back later to improve on this project by adding things like users profiles and authentication, private messaging, and so on.

Feel free to use this as a starting point for your project.

Happy coding!
